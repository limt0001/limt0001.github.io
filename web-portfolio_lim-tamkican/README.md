This web portfolio was created by Jennifer Lim-Tamkican.

I started by laying out the html of all three pages, then styling mobile to desktop respectively. In creating this portfolio, I ran into some trouble with the black and white assets being inconsistant and causing me to have to create a second set of assets in both colors in order to switch between the two. This created some unnecessarily long coding which I will need to revisit in the future.
I also ran into some trouble with have the background image switch from being just a fixed image to being the background image, it created a lot of confusion for the rest of the content. I ended up once again having to create some hidden elements for switching between mobile and desktop views which I feel like could be better done in the future as well. 
I learned how to create a gallery grid that allows me to add more content in the future which is really cool.

I deviated from the mockup a little on the project page for the mobile and tablet views as I wanted the final website to include the project images. I also added a hover function over the projects listings for added affect and interactivity. 

All fonts were from Google fonts.
